# DO NOT USE!!!

This is extremely old and I don't even remember why I did this ages ago! 
I have since long become alergic to code like this that allows your to 
go and edit files codewise like this. 

I've tried to delete this old stuff, but failed to find a way to do 
that. Maybe it isn't possilbe to do for free open source accounts. 

So I just say this: 

---
## This code is a pile of shit! Should not be used by anyone for anything!

Provides a maven plugin for running BeanShell scripts with a FileEdtior instance and a file to edit loaded to edit any text file. Also provides a library of scripts to edit pom.xml. 

This was basically made to edit pom for maven central submission requirements so that I can clone my repository, run the edit, submit, and then throw away the clone without damaging my original.

But you can make any creative edit of source with own scripts to this plugin. Updating displayed version for example. See the [FileEditor](https://github.com/tombensve/FileEditor/blob/master/docs/FileEditor.md) doucmentation for how the FileEditor works.
